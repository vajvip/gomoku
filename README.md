## 🚀 Quick Start

This is a zero-setup project. Pick any method:

### Option 1 — Just open it
Double-click `index.html` to open it directly in your default browser.

### Option 2 — Local server (recommended)
For best behavior (especially on mobile), serve it over HTTP:

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000
# then visit http://localhost:8000

# Node.js
npx serve .

# PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

### Option 3 — Deploy
Drop `index.html` onto any static host: GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, etc.

## 🎯 How to Play

1. **Black moves first**, then players alternate.
2. Click (or tap) on any intersection to place a stone.
3. The first player to line up **five stones** in a row — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally — wins.
4. The winning line is highlighted in red.

### Controls
- **Place stone** — click/tap an empty intersection
- **Undo** — take back the last move(s)
- **Restart** — clear the board and start over
- **Game Mode** — switch between 👥 PVP and 🤖 vs AI
- **AI Difficulty** — Easy / Normal / Hard (PVE only)
- **AI Plays** — choose whether the AI controls ⚫ Black or ⚪ White
- **Forbidden moves** — toggle Renju restrictions on Black

## 🤖 AI Details

The AI uses a combination of techniques, scaled by difficulty:

| Level | Strategy |
|-------|----------|
| **Easy** | Greedy heuristic scoring with randomized tie-breaking among top moves |
| **Normal** | 1-ply search combining offensive gain and defensive blocking; detects and blocks immediate threats (fours, open-fours) |
| **Hard** | Depth-2 **minimax with alpha-beta pruning** over the top-ranked candidate moves, plus immediate-win/threat detection |

Candidate moves are restricted to cells near existing stones (within radius 2), keeping
the search tractable. Stones are scored using pattern recognition across four directions
(open four, four, open three, split three, two, etc.).

## ⛔ Forbidden Moves (Renju)

When enabled, this rule set (traditionally applied to **Black only**, since Black has the
first-move advantage) prohibits:

- **Overline** — six or more in a row (a line of *exactly* five still wins)
- **Double-three (3-3)** — creating two open threes simultaneously
- **Double-four (4-4)** — creating two fours simultaneously

A move that forms exactly five always overrides the forbidden rule and wins immediately.
Violations are flagged in the status panel.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML5 Canvas** for board rendering (with high-DPI support)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (ES6+) for all game logic and AI — no frameworks
- **CSS3** with custom properties, gradients, and a responsive grid layout
- **Zero external dependencies** — everything lives in one ~30 KB file

## 🧩 Customization

All tuning lives at the top of the `<script>` block and in the `:root` CSS variables:

- `SIZE` — change board dimensions (e.g. `19` for a Go-sized board)
- `--wood`, `--accent`, etc. — recolor the board and UI
- `PATTERNS` array — adjust AI pattern weights
- `aiDifficulty` search depth — extend for a stronger (slower) AI
